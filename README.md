# **BLACKBOARD.APP**

Welcome to Blackboard! The online gradebook app built for teachers! With this app you can manage your classrooms, manage and see info for students in those classrooms, as well as manage assignments and grading. All in one place! 

## Why I chose Blackboard.

I was looking to build an app that would use both embedded and referenced data models. Furthermore, I wanted to practice building an online platform that would eventually have users, where both teacher and student could interact.



## Instructions

1. To manage your classrooms, navigate to the classrooms tab in the navbar. This will take you to
a page where all of your current classrooms will be displayed. 

2. To add a classroom, click Add a Classroom at the bottom of the page. This will bring up the Add Class form where you can enter details about the class. Hit submit. This will redirect you to
the classrooms index page.

3.  To see the current students in your class, simiply click on the class title in the classroom index. This will display a list of all the current students in that specific class.

>From this page you may Edit Class Info, Add a new Student, or Delete the current classroom. *NOTE:
Deleting the current classroom will delete ALL student records within that classroom!*

4. To add a student, click Add a student. This will bring up a form where information about the 
student can be entered. This includes things like Name, Grade, whether or not they have an IEP, any notes you have about the student, and a grade average of all their assignments. Hit submit and the app will redirect you to the display page of the specific classroom where that student was added. 

>*Currently the Assignments page does not exist, and grade averages must be entered manually -09.12.25*

5. To Edit a students info, click on the students name in the Current Students tab. This will display all the current info on the student. Click Edit Student Info to update this students info. Click Remove Student to delete this student's record from the class.
